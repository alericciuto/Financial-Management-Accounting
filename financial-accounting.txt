FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

WHY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING?


It provides the "numbers" we normally hear about a company (revenues, profit, assets
value, ...)


It is a "fundamental" part of company evaluation, i.e. it contributes (together with
"expectations") to determine:
  the shares' price and market capitalization of a company in the day by day trading (financial 
  analysis)
  the target price in an M&A (financial due diligence)
  the selling price of shares in an IPO (financial due diligence)
  the credit stability (rating services)

Summary and conclusions


MAIN OBJECTIVES


Financial Accounting identifies data and information a company must collect, organise
and present to shareholders and stakeholders (banks and bondholders, customers and
suppliers, public authorities) to accomplish normative duties

Data and information are presented in an official document called Annual Report
(Financial Statements), summarising
  the monetary value of assets the company has under its availability in a given point in time 
  (usually the end of the year)
  and the economic
  and financial transactions the company undertook in a given period of time (usually an year)

"Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be
counted" (Albert Einstein)


ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

   Accounting Principles or Standards define

     where to register (format of Financial Statements)

     what to register (definition of assets/liabilities, revenues/costs, cash    inflows/outflows)

     how to register (revision of the calculation of the monetary value of
     accounting items).


     ... any item or event with an economic and/or financial impact

   

ANNUAL REPORT: KEY DOCUMENTS


IAS/IFRS define the structure of annual report as constituted by 5 compulsory
documents:

  -BALANCE SHEET
    describing the monetary value of assets and related rights (equity and
  liabilities) in a given point in time (usually, midnight of 31/12 of each year)

  -STATEMENT OF INCOME (PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT)
    describing the economic value (revenues and costs) of physical and
  financial transactions undertaken by the company in a given period (usually,
  one year) 

   -STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     summarising the effects on shareholders' equity of physical and financial
   transactions undertaken by the company in a given period (usually, one year)

   -STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW
     summarising the results (inflows and outflows) of the financial transactions
   undertaken by the company in a given period (usually, one year)

   -NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     describing the rules followed and hypothesis made in drafting of the annual
   report, and all complementary data and information needed to allow the reader to
   interpret the other documents
    

    MATCHING PRINCIPLE


    The matching principle used in Annual Report is the accrual-basis accounting

    Accrual-basis accounting records events based on economic activity rather than
     financial activity. Under accrual accounting, revenue is recorded when it is earned     and realised, regardless of when actual payment is received. Similarly, expenses are    "matched" to revenues regardless of when they are actually paid.
     and realised, regardless of when actual payment is received. Similarly, expenses are    "matched" to revenues regardless of when they are actually paid.

    Accrual-basis accounting is opposed to cash-basis accounting under which revenues
     are recognised when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid

    Net profit is then a result of the "matching" between economic events (revenues and
     costs)

     

   ANNUAL REPORT: KEY DOCUMENTS

   Listed companies are also requested to provide:

     the report of independent auditors, stating that the annual report gives a    true and fair view of the situation of the company

     the report of supervisory board, stating that the decisions undertaken by     the company's management are compliant with the normative and
     statutory requirements

     a management report, providing the view of the management and also
     additional comments to the results reported in the annual report


   

BALANCE SHEET

Balance Sheet describes the monetary value of assets and related rights (equity and
liabilities) in a given point in time (usually, midnight of 31/12 of each year)

                         ASSETS            LIABILITIES
                      (RESOURCES)           (RIGHTS)

              Assets are identified by    Liabilities are defined as 
              the presence of a direct or present obligations of an 
              indirect contribution to    entity arising from past 
              the financial flows (or     transactions or events, 
              equivalents) that will      the settlement of which 
              arrive to the companies.    may result in the transfer 
              Ownership is not            or use of assets, 
              essential in recognising    provision of services or 
              assets                      other yielding of 
                                          economic benefits in the 
                                          future.


IAS/IFRS do not identify a rigid framework ... and therefore each company may decide how to draft its Balance Sheet
                   

ASSETS
   - NON-CURRENT ASSETS
	   Property, plant and equipment 
	   Investment property
	   Goodwil
	   Other intangible assets
	   Equity investment
	   Other non-current financial assets 
	   Deferred tax
   - CURRENT ASSETS (Assets held for collection,trading, sale, or consumption within the enterprise's normal operating cycle (12 months))
	   Trade and other receivables 
	   Inventories
	   Ordered work in progress 
	   Short-term financial assets 
	   Cash and cash equivalents
   - ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND DISPOSAL GROUPS (The common feature of non current assets held for sale and disposal groups is that the carrying value is expected to be realised through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale when it is immediately available for sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable.)

At the finish of each company's operating cycle (usually, midnight of 31/12 of each year), the value of the Total Assets has to be equal to the sum of Total Liabilities and Equity)              


STATEMENT OF INCOME

It describes the economic value (revenues and costs) of physical and financial
transactions undertaken by the company in a given period (usually, one year)

It is drafted accordingly to the accrual-basis accounting

IAS allow to present Statement of Income (Profit and Loss Account) under two forms:
  by nature, where costs are aggregated on the basis of their nature (raw materials, staff 	costs, depreciation and amortisation, ...)

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW


It summarises the results (inflows and outflows) of the financial transactions
undertaken by the company in a given period (usually, one year)

IAS/IFRS consider two options in presenting the Statement of cash flow:
  direct method (preferred method), where cash inflows and outflows are classified by nature
  indirect method, where cash inflows and outflows are initially derived by adjusting net profit 
  for the effects of non-cash transactions (e.g., depreciations)


Statement of cash flow classifies cash inflows and outflows in three category:
  cash flow from operations, i.e., financial flows related to the main revenue-producing activities of the company

  cash flow from investing activities, i.e., financial flows related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other non-financial investments

  cash flow from financing activities, i.e., financial flows related to changes in the equity capital and debts of the company, as well as in financial investments

OBJECTIVE AND TOOLS


The aim of the analysis of an Annual Report is to provide a quick and useful overview of
the company's main results

Ratio analysis, summarizing information particularly concerning the economic profit
achieved and its main components (profitability analysis) and the status of liquidity
and its "coherence" with existing present obligations (liquidity analysis)


"Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity and cash is reality"  

RATIO ANALYSIS


The use of ratios instead of absolute numbers (i.e. the single item of annual report's
documents) gives more information on the ability of a company of making profit
and/or generating cash

• Ratios allow
  • to compare present with past company's performance (usually 2-3
    years) and to define an historical trend for each ratio, further
    investigating potential impacts of contingencies or non-ordinary
    events related to the company's own activities
  • to compare the performance of the company with that of other firms
    (usually main competitors), further investigating potential impacts of
    contingencies or non-ordinary events related to the industryhes where
    the company operates

    

RATIO ANALYSIS


Ratios are powerful tools in supporting analysis of annual reports, as they provide a quick
measure of company's performance and they signal where further investigation is
needed

Ratios, however, have to be carefully managed:

     in defining comparable firms, it should be taken into account also:
          • accounting principles adopted (e.g., IAS/IFRS, US Gaap)
          • evaluation criteria used for main items (e.g. cost model vs. fair value model for property, plant and 
            equipment)

     in calculating ratios involving balance sheet items, it is needed to define whether the 
     calculation is made on:
          • year-end value
          • initial value
          • average value

                             

PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS

    The aim of profitability analysis is to evaluate the ability of the company in making
    profit and to identify its main components

    Profitability analysis can be done under three different perspectives:

      shareholders' perspective, assuming net profit (i.e. the "reward" of shareholders) as main item of analysis

      overall company's perspective, assuming operating profit (i.e. EBIT) as main item of analysis

      stakeholders' perspective, analysing the effects of I (interest) and T (Taxes) on the final net profit (E)
        

SHAREHOLDERS' PERSPECTIVE


Ratios commonly used under the shareholders' perspective are:


                               
  ROE (Return on Equity) (%) = Net Profit / Shareholders' Equity

  It is among the most used and renown ratios.
  It measures the "interest rate" on shareholders' equity, i.e. how much they earned on the investment 
  they made in the company.
  The higher is the ratio, the better managers are using the equity base for running the company

                                        
  Net Profit Margin (%) =    Net Profit / Revenues

   It is also known as bottom line margin.
   It measures the percentage of profit shareholders can retain from revenues (i.e. the starting 
   point of Income Statement).
   It is to remember, however, that in real companies positive contributions to profit can be 
   referred also to:
      • variations of fair value
      • gains on sale of assets
      • reversion of provisions
      • financial incomes
      • income from discontinued operations
      • •••
   It should not be taken as the only reference number for evaluating a company.
            

OVERALL COMPANY'S PERSPECTIVE

   Ratios commonly used under the overall company's perspective are:

   ROI or ROA (%) (Return on Investment or Return on Assets) =     Operating Profit (EBIT) / Total Assets 
   
   It measures the ability of managers to generate profit by using company's assets for 
   continuing business operations. It is also used in managers' internal evaluation. The higher is 
   the better.    

                          
  Operating Profit Margin (%) =     Operating Profit (EBIT) / Revenues 

  Asset Turnover Ratio (abs.) =    Revenues / Total Assets
                                

  EBITDA Margin (%)(eventually using notes to financial statements) = (Operating Profit + Depreciation + Amortisation) / Revenues

  They further defines the profit components related to continuing business operations, and particularly 
  the impact of depreciation and amortisation of assets (EBITDA margin)
  EBITDA margin is also used for better comparing companies operating in the same industry but with 
  a different degree of vertical integration
     

STAKEHOLDERS' PERSPECTIVE

	Ratios commonly used under the stakeholders' perspective are:
	
    Debt-to-Equity Ratio or Gearing (abs.) = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity
                        
    Interest Rate (I R) (%) (eventually using notes to financial statements) = Interest Expenses / Total Liabilities
           
    They measure respectively:
       • the commitment in the company's capital of suppliers, lenders, creditors and other non-equity 
         investors versus the commitment of shareholders
       • the relative weight of interest expenses (i.e., the cost of outstanding debt) on the total liabilities 
         (the lower the ratio, the less the company is burdened by debt expense)


                                 
    Effective Tax Rate (T) (%) = Net Earnings / Pre-tax Profit       

    It measure the effective weight of taxation on the company's profit    

PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS FINANCIAL LEVERAGE - Financial Leverage

    ROE = [ROI + Debt-to-Equity x (ROI - IR)] x T

    The relation between ROI and ROE is mediated by the effect of debts

    Increasing Debt-to-Equity Ratio, e.g., increasing bank debts or issuing new bonds,
    amplifies (other things being equal) ROE over ROI

    ... but be aware of the trap! ... increasing D-to-E Ratio also amplifies IR as it increases the amount of interest to be paid
                                                            

LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS

• The aim of liquidity analysis is to evaluate the status of liquidity and its
  "coherence" with existing present obligations, i.e. the ability of the
  company to meet its financial obligations when claimed by owners of related
  rights


• Ratios are then used under two different perspectives:
  —Assets-Liabilities perspective, analysing "liquidity" items in Balance Sheet
  —Cash Flow perspective, analysing "liquidity" items in Cash Flow Statement   

LIQUIDITY RATIOS: ASSETS-LIABILITIES PERSPECTIVE     

	Ratios commonly used under the assets-liabilities perspective are:   
                                
        Current Ratio (abs.)  =      Current Assets / Current Liabilities        
		
		Quick Ratio (abs.) (also known as Acid Test Ratio) = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities
                      
	They measure to what extent company's current assets (in the quick ratio further refined by isolating 
	only most liquid assets) are readily available to pay off its current liabilities.
	The higher the ratios, the better ... unless they hidden the fact the company is not able to invest its money ...                     

LIQUIDITY RATIOS: CASH FLOW PERSPECTIVE

Ratios commonly used under the cash flow perspective are:

  Cash Flow-to-Debt Ratio (abs.) =  Operating Cash Flow / Non-current Liabilities

  Short-term Debt Cove rag e(a bs.) = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  

  Capital Expenditure Coverage (abs.) = Operating Cash Flow / Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)
         
  They measure the ability of operating cash flow to meet company's financial obligations concerning 
  liabilities and ongoing investments. The higher the ratios, the better
    

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


"It is very easy for people approaching ratios for the first time to go through a series of
reactions, initially seeing the calculation of the ratios as an end in itself and then later
asking what use the ratios are for"


Annual Report analysis sheds light on certain aspects of the company but at the very
end is the analyst who has to provide his/her own interpretation


Remembering that:
  not all the ratios have the same relevance
  ratios pose questions more than providing answers
